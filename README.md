# dungeonseek
This is a text based adventure game I am currently making with my brother using Python 3. 
It is an RPG where the player moves through a series of rooms and battles multiple types of monsters. It includes combat, magic, and level-up systems. 
To run the program, download the file and run the main_game.py file.
